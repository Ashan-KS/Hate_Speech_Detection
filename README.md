# Hate Speech Detection using LSTM

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model is trained on a dataset containing labelled text data, classifying content as hate speech, offensive speech and neither. The primary goal was to build a deep learning-based NLP model that can effectively identify harmful content in social media posts and online discussions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset

## ðŸ§  Model Used
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
- The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Preprocessing Steps
  1. **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary characters and extra spacing.
  2. **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form.
  3. **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words that do not contribute to meaning.
  4. **One-Hot Encoding**: Transforming words into numerical representation.
  5. **Padding**: Ensuring all sequences have the same length.
  6. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Addressing class imbalance by generating synthetic samples.
